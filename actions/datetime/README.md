# DateTime Actions

Actions for working with dates and times in Power Automate Desktop. These actions provide the exact, pasteable syntax that works when copied into PAD.

## Important Notes

- Each syntax line must be pasted exactly as shown
- Placeholders are shown with backticks (``) - replace these with your values
- Do not add extra spaces, line breaks, or formatting
- Times are typically handled in seconds for maximum compatibility
- Test any modifications before using in production

## Available Actions

- [Add to DateTime](./add-to-datetime.md)
- [Get Current DateTime](./get-current-datetime.md)

## Common Time Conversions

- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds 
- 1 day = 86400 seconds
- 1 week = 604800 seconds
- 1 month (30 days) = 2592000 seconds

When adding time values, convert to seconds for consistent behavior.
